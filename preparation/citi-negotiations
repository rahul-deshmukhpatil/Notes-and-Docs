strategy:	
	Make notes
	Ask questions:
		Extra benefits
		Leaves
		Promotions and Choosing between technical and management side


How were the interviews.
	Excellent. I was thrilled by the diverse veriety of the questions they asked.
	I liked there way of testing candidates. They shown nice gesture for the candidates.
	Seems like nice team.
		With first I had with australian team lead, We talked ab team, work, then we discussed various scenarios
	of technical things. I greatly appreciate his vision for the team. I do posses command over some developmental tools which conventional developers do not have. I think found these skills unique for the position. 
		Later I talked with whole india team. Seems like team with great team spirit. We discussed c++, programming and other design
	questions in great details. They seems to be happy with the answers and practical real world exmaple/scenarios
	I answered to them.
		Later in talk with the Rohit, we discussed various work scenarios, the responsibilities and my achievements
	and my work relationship with the VPs work at CITI market data europe, and other companies. He was happy that I
	have worked with CITI guys before, couple of whom he knows. We discussed what is procedure of bringing up guy to the productive level in inital days.


Is it ok if we talk about some other things first. Salary discussion is important for me as well as you. But it will be good 
	to discuss the other things first, as salary will not be the only thing I will be only looking from CITI as future employer
	So what are the things, you could tell me that,  I should join CITI for. 
	So what about the future role after i will be having to choose techical and management work after say 12-15 years of experience.
		my aim is to become a techical architect, who designs the software systems.
	So what kind of extra benefits you give.
		Well I get free travel and free food here. But I am sure that you will consider that while we discussing the money.
	

Notice Period Negotiations:
	See the company does not negotiate based upon the money.
	But since I have joined them very early during the operation of the company and my relations with the managers,
	upon sincierly requesting and completing all my tasks, I think they could release me in just 3 weeks to 1 month as well.
	See it will take atleast a week after resignation, that they will agree to leave me, till that point they will try to pursuade me.
	But once I say YES to you, that is yes, and I will join you. I give high importance to my commitements.  
	Are you guys ready to take me in with all the required documents, if I say I can join within two/three weeks, after a week of 
	resignation.	

	
What are your expectations:
	Well crucial question. Considering my performace during the interview, reputation of CITI itself, work responsibilty and challeging work of the new role. And my position and hard work I done with my curreny and previous employers. I think i must have got the good grades.
<<	See if you see my move from previous employer to current employer I did not really get as such hike. I was earning around 6L fix and around 2.5L work stock options which could be disbursed perodically. While SRLabs just gave me 7.5L fixed+ some bonus around 70K. being small company, a startup like, influence by VCs after funding and recent aqusition of another company, SRLabs really could not benefit me on money side. Though I made some money from my UK trip, that was purely out of my saving, so my current salary is not market offsetted. >>	
	So I expect around 60-70% hike wrt my current inhand salary. I do get extra benefits like free food which I have not got chance to mentione anywhere. So I am expecting aroung 17L. 
	And it is not going to only my work. I have worked at SRLabs from its almost initial days. you guys use SRLabs software. I could really benifit the other teams and save thier time on SRLabs software easily. And I am willing to help them in every possible way.  	
	Here in current company I do carry out other responsibilities like handling office, mentor new-joinies, handle  european clients developemnt work with co-ordination. So I am much mature resource you would say, who has vast amount of experience in just 5 years.
	I am passionate about finance technologies  and I move myself only when I am intereted in work and I make decisions on long term basis.
	And I have already worked with the three major investement banks, Morgan Stanley, JP morgan Eu, Citi Europe.

What if you leave us/deny coming after getting this offer letter.
	See I could really undestand this situation. I do handle india recruitement on my own as a side responsibilty.
	I find team I am joining cool and experienced. 
	If we are agreeing over everything over the phone, I am ready to resign right now after the call.  
	I think before taking decisions and saying Yes, But I honor my words once said. I know many of your employees with whom
	I have worked perviously and << my own cousin as well works with you >>.  


Now last thing:
	Do you allowed to take leave if manager i am reporting to agrees.
	See I will be completing my 5 years of carrer in next couple of months. So we guys had planned for a trip to himalayas in may as all of us are avid trekker. We have booked all the tickets even before we started with the interview procedure of the CITI. and there is another high probable event is that all of us might get married in next year or two. So will I be allowed to take a complete week off in may. 
	See I could join much before the actual notice period and that too smoothly. I do have tickets to prove that this had been planned early.
	Again I am not hard on this. See if it is possible, otherwise it is ok, I could cancel my tickets and plan.   
	I will make it some other time and I am sure that mine friends will undestand.
