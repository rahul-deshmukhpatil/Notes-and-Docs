1. why inline functions are defined in only .h files
	http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9338152/must-the-definition-of-a-c-inline-functions-be-in-the-same-file?rq=1

	It's imperative that the function's definition (the part between the {...}) be placed in a header file, unless the function is used only in a single .cpp file.
	In particular, if you put the inline function's definition into a .cpp file and you call it from some other .cpp file, you'll get an "unresolved external" error from the linker.
	Some compilers have features for optimizing the whole program at once (Whole program optimization or Link time optimization). These compilers can inline a function even if it is defined in a different .cpp file.

2. Inline functions cant contain recursion, go to loops etc?
	http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16921953/inline-functions-cant-contain-recursion-go-to-loops-etc
	Recursion is a different story. Obviously, it is not possible to completely inline all nested recursive calls if the depth of recursion is not known at compile time. Yet it is still possible to "unwrap" recursion to a specific limited depth. I.e. the compiler can inline the recursive calls, say, 5 levels deep and then proceed with a genuine (non-inlined) recursive call. This is not much different from the optimization technique known as "cycle unrolling". So, even recursive functions can be inlined. Some compilers can even let you control the depth of inline expansion for recursive functions.
	he definition of an inline function needs to be present in every translation unit calling the function.
So yes, you can call inline-functions in loops, there is nothing wrong with it.

3. What is declspec
	The canonical examples are __declspec(dllimport) and __declspec(dllexport), which instruct the linker to import and export (respectively) a symbol from or to a DLL.
	(__declspec(..) just wraps up Microsoft's specific stuff - to achieve compatibility, one would usually wrap it away with macros)
	how do you know wich dll dllimport is pointing at? you don't know from the code. The decision is made by the linker, who will pick the first .lib it finds that has a matching exported symbol

		#if defined(_MSC_VER)
			//  Microsoft 
			#define EXPORT __declspec(dllexport)
			#define IMPORT __declspec(dllimport)
		#elif defined(_GCC)
			//  GCC
			#define EXPORT __attribute__((visibility("default")))
			#define IMPORT
		#else
			//  do nothing and hope for the best?
			#define EXPORT
			#define IMPORT
			#pragma warning Unknown dynamic link import/export semantics.
		#endif

4. what are pragma?
	This is a preprocessor directive that can be used to turn on or off certain features. It is of two types #pragma startup, #pragma exit and pragma warn.
	pragma startup allows us to specify functions called upon program startup.
	pragma exit allows us to specify functions called upon program exit.
	pragma warn tells the computer to suppress any warning or not.
	many other #pragma style that can use to control compiler

	I would generally try to avoid the use of #pragmas if possible, since they're extremely compiler-dependent and non-portable. If you want to use them in a portable fashion, you'll have to surround every pragma with a #if/#endif pair. GCC discourages the use of pragmas, and really only supports some of them for compatibility with other compilers; GCC has other ways of doing the same things that other compilers use pragmas for.
	
5. Disable pading and packing.
	MSVC:
	#pragma pack(push, 1) 
	struct PackedStructure

	GCC:
	struct PackedStructure __attribute__((__packed__)) 

6. Getting and Setting env variables in c code?
	char *getenv(const char *name);
    char *secure_getenv(const char *name);
	int setenv(const char *name, const char *value, int overwrite);
    int unsetenv(const char *name);

7. Some common gcc options
	 -pie
           Produce a position independent executable on targets that support it.  For predictable results, you must also specify the same
           set of options used for compilation (-fpie, -fPIE, or model suboptions) when you specify this linker option.
	-rdynamic
           Pass the flag -export-dynamic to the ELF linker, on targets that support it. This instructs the linker to add all symbols, not
           only used ones, to the dynamic symbol table. This option is needed for some uses of "dlopen" or to allow obtaining backtraces
           from within a program.
	-static
           On systems that support dynamic linking, this prevents linking with the shared libraries.  On other systems, this option has no
           effect.
	-shared
           Produce a shared object which can then be linked with other objects to form an executable.  Not all systems support this option.
           For predictable results, you must also specify the same set of options used for compilation (-fpic, -fPIC, or model suboptions)
           when you specify this linker option.[1]
	-Wl,option
           Pass option as an option to the linker.  If option contains commas, it is split into multiple options at the commas.  You can
           use this syntax to pass an argument to the option.  For example, -Wl,-Map,output.map passes -Map output.map to the linker.  When
           using the GNU linker, you can also get the same effect with -Wl,-Map=output.map.
	 -lobjc
           You need this special case of the -l option in order to link an Objective-C or Objective-C++ program.


8.	When are static C++ class members initialized?
	http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1421671/when-are-static-c-class-members-initialized
	The standard guarantees two things - that objects defined in the same translation unit (usually it means .cpp file) are initialized in order of their definitions (not declarations):
	The other guaranteed thing is that initialization of static objects from a translation unit will be done before use of any object or function from this translation unit:
	it is also guaranteed that they are initialized before main is entered



9.	Difference between private, public, and protected inheritance?
	http://stackoverflow.com/questions/860339/difference-between-private-public-and-protected-inheritance?lq=1
	class Base {
    public:
        int publicMember;
    protected:
        int protectedMember;
    private:
        int privateMember;
	};
	Everything that is aware of Base is also aware that Base contains publicMember.
	Only the children (and their children) are aware that Base contains protectedMember.
	No one but Base is aware of privateMember.
	next:
	The same happens with public, private and protected inheritance. Let's consider a class Base and a class Child that inherits from Base.
	If the inheritance is public, everything that is aware of Base and Child is also aware that Child inherits from Base.
	If the inheritance is protected, only Child, and its children, are aware that they inherit from Base.
	If the inheritance is private, no one other than Child is aware of the inheritance.

10.	When to use the private and public inheritance?
	http://stackoverflow.com/questions/20261690/what-is-the-practical-use-of-protected-inheritance
	That you might not see reasons for private inheritance does not mean it's pointless. There are several cases where private inheritance has it's reasons. You are right in that at a first glance, private inheritance means has-a relationships just like aggregation, and that private inheritance has a (slightly) tighter coupling.

	Reasons for favouring private inheritance over aggretations could be some of the following:

	With private inheritance you inherit typedefs as well. In some cases (e.g. traits classes) inheriting privatly is just the alternative to re-typedef tons of typedefs in the base class.
	In seldom cases you have to initialize a member before a "real" (i.e. public) base class. The only way to achieve that is by making that member a private base class inherited before the public base.
	Some times you need access to protected members of a member. If you can't change the member class itself, you have to use private inheritance to get access to them.
	If a member has no data members of its own, it still occupies space. Making it a private base class enables the empty base class optimization, diminuishing the size of your class' objects.
	for even more points, see James' comments below
	These reasons are obviously technical reasons, some might even say "hacks". However, such reasons exist, so private inheritance is not completely pointless. It is just not "pure OO style" - but C++ isn't a pure OO language either.

	The reason for protected inheritance are quite simple once you understood the ones for private inheritance:

	If you have reasons to inherit something privately and want to make those benefits (i.e. that would-be member of your class or the typedefs) accessible to derived classes, use protected inheritance. Obviously, private inheritance should be used scarcely, and protected inheritance even more so.

	the base class provides a customizable implementation, using the template method pattern, and you have to override its virtual functions.


11. Why is C++ not an Object Oriented language?
	http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3498730/why-is-c-not-an-object-oriented-language
	C++ is usually considered a "multi-paradigm" language. That is, you can use it for object-oriented, procedural, and even functional programming.Those who would deny that C++ is OO generally have beef with the fact that the primitive types are not objects themselves. By this standard, Java would also not be considered OO.It is certainly true that C++ isn't OO to the same extent as Smalltalk, Ruby, Self, etc. are, but it is definitely an effective OO language by most standards.

12. Overloading member access operators ->, .* (C++)
	http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8777845/overloading-member-access-operators-c
	->

	This is the only really tricky one. It must be a nonstatic member function, and it takes no arguments. The return value is used to perform the member lookup. If the return value is another object of class type, not a pointer, then the subsequent member lookup is also handled by an operator-> function. This is called the "drill-down behavior." The language chains together the operator-> calls until the last one returns a pointer.

	struct client
		{ int a; };

	struct proxy {
		client *target;
		client *operator->() const
			{ return target; }
	};

	struct proxy2 {
		proxy *target;
		proxy &operator->() const
			{ return * target; }
	};

	void f() {
		client x = { 3 };
		proxy y = { & x };
		proxy2 z = { & y };

		std::cout << x.a << y->a << z->a; // print "333"
	}
	->*

	This one is only tricky in that there is nothing special about it. The non-overloaded version requires an object of pointer to class type on the left-hand side and an object of pointer to member type on the right. But when you overload it, you can take any arguments you like and return anything you want. It doesn't even have to be a nonstatic member.
	In other words, this one is just a normal binary operator like +, -, and /. See also: Are free operator->* overloads evil?

	.* and .

	These cannot be overloaded. There is already a built-in meaning when the left-hand side is of class type. Perhaps it would make a little sense to be able to define them for a pointer on the left-hand side, but the language design committee decided that would be more confusing than useful.

	Overloading ->, ->*, ., and .* can only fill in cases where an expression would be undefined, it can never change the meaning of an expression that would be valid with no overloading.

13. Auto_ptr:
		deprecated as of C++11,  unique_ptr is a new facility with a similar functionality, but with improved security (no fake copy assignments), added features (deleters) and support for arrays. 
	This class template provides a limited garbage collection facility for pointers, by allowing pointers to have the elements they point to automatically destroyed when the auto_ptr object is itself destroyed.
	No two auto_ptr objects should own the same element, since both would try to destruct them at some point. When an assignment operation takes place between two auto_ptr objects, ownership is transferred

	get
	Get pointer (public member function )
	operator*
	Dereference object (public member function )
	operator->
	Dereference object member (public member function )
	operator=
	Release and copy auto_ptr (public member function )
	release
	Release pointer (public member function )
	reset
	Deallocate object pointed and set new value (public member function )
	(conversion operators)
	Conversion operators (public member function )

14. shared_ptr:
	Objects of shared_ptr types have the ability of taking ownership of a pointer and share that ownership: once they take ownership, the group of owners of a pointer become responsible for its deletion when the last one of them releases that ownership.

shared_ptr objects release ownership on the object they co-own as soon as they themselves are destroyed, or as soon as their value changes either by an assignment operation or by an explicit call to shared_ptr::reset. Once all shared_ptr objects that share ownership over a pointer have released this ownership, the managed object is deleted (normally by calling ::delete, but a different deleter may be specified on construction).

shared_ptr objects can only share ownership by copying their value: If two shared_ptr are constructed (or made) from the same (non-shared_ptr) pointer, they will both be owning the pointer without sharing it, causing potential access problems when one of them releases it (deleting its managed object) and leaving the other pointing to an invalid location.

Additionally, shared_ptr objects can share ownership over a pointer while at the same time pointing to another object. This ability is known as aliasing (see constructors), and is commonly used to point to member objects while owning the object they belong to. Because of this, a shared_ptr may relate to two pointers:

15. weak_ptr
	std::weak_ptr is a smart pointer that holds a non-owning ("weak") reference to an object that is managed by std::shared_ptr. It must be converted to std::shared_ptr in order to access the referenced object.
std::weak_ptr models temporary ownership: when an object needs to be accessed only if it exists, and it may be deleted at any time by someone else, std::weak_ptr is used to track the object, and it is converted to std::shared_ptr to assume temporary ownership. If the original std::shared_ptr is destroyed at this time, the object's lifetime is extended until the temporary std::shared_ptr is destroyed as well.
In addition, std::weak_ptr is used to break circular references of std::shared_ptr.

16. Why is std::map implemented as a red-black tree?
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5288320/why-is-stdmap-implemented-as-a-red-black-tree
	It really depends on the usage. AVL tree has higher complexity of rebalancing. So if your application doesn't have too many insertion and deletion operations, but weights heavily on searching, then AVL tree probably is a good choice.
	std::map uses Red-Black tree as it gets a reasonable trade-off between the complexity of node insertion/deletion and searching.

17.	How is C++ std::vector implemented?
	http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2096571/how-is-c-stdvector-implemented 
	It's implemented by using an underlying array.
	It's not possible to implement a std::vector<T> with a linked list because the standard guarantees the elements in the list will be held in contiguous memory.

18.	What is the underlying data structure of a STL set in C++?
	http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10375334/what-kind-of-tree-implementation-is-stl-set
	The standard imposes no restrictions on the implementation (other than the complexity guarantees).
	In other words, it's implementation-dependent. Typically, it's a red-black tree (see e.g. /usr/include/c++/x.y.z/bits/stl_tree.h, where x.y.z is your particular GCC version).

25.	Difference between auto_ptr and unique_ptr
	You cannot do a global find/replace because you can copy an auto_ptr (with known consequences), but a unique_ptr can only be moved. Anything that looks like
	std::auto_ptr<int> p(new int);
	std::auto_ptr<int> p2 = p; 
	will have to become at least like this
	std::unique_ptr<int> p(new int);
	std::unique_ptr<int> p2 = std::move(p);
	As for other differences, unique_ptr can handle arrays correctly (it will call delete[], while auto_ptr will attempt to call delete.

26. Nested classes possible in c++?
	yes. Nested Inner class can access private member of the Outer class.
	Nester Inner class is friend of the outer class.

					  Inner() {}
					  void func() ;

		  private:
			  static const char* const MYCONST;
			  int var;

		  };

		  void Outer::Inner::func() {
