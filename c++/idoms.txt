	some times might override operator&, so template function, which 
	1. for object types(class, arry, union, ) first reinteprete cast<const volatile char&>
		then to  &const_cast<char&> then to 
	2. for function and ref types its just returning T& 
	3. takding address of rvalue ref is = delete  in C++17

Base-from-Member
	1. if want to initialize derived member before base class. 
	2. make a dummy class class for derived member and put it before base class in class declaration
		class Derived : DummyDervMemberClass, BaseClass

Calling Virtuals During Initialization
	1. such derived overridden virt must not access any data members of derived, they are in invalid state
	2. Use two phase initialization to call virt from init method
	3. Use CRTP to call static or non static members
