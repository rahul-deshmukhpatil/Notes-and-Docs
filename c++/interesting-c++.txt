attributes may appear 
	before, after func name 
		[[noreturn]] void f [[noreturn]] (); // okay: both attributes apply to the function f
	after func params: definition is not affected. its only type
		void f() [[noreturn]]; // error: this attribute has no effect on the function itself



if decltype(auto) is used means ret type is same if ret statement would have been wrapped  in ()
	int x = 1;
	decltype(auto) f() { return x; }  // return type is int, same as decltype(x)
	decltype(auto) f() { return(x); } // return type is int&, same as decltype((x))
