First, when you buy an option, you have a right but not an obligation to do something.
Second, an option is merely a contract that deals with an underlying asset. For this reason, options are called derivatives, which means an
option derives its value from something else.

Calls and Puts
The two types of options are calls and puts:
	1. 
	A call gives the holder the right to buy an asset at a certain price within a
	specific period of time. Calls are similar to having a long position on a
	stock. Buyers of calls hope that the stock will increase substantially before
	the option expires.
	2. 
	A put gives the holder the right to sell an asset at a certain price within a
	specific period of time. Puts are very similar to having a short position on a
	stock. Buyers of puts hope that the price of the stock will fall before the
	option expires.

Participants in the Options Market
There are four types of participants in options markets depending on the
position they take:
	Buyers of calls
	Sellers of calls
	Buyers of puts
	Sellers of puts
	
	People who buy options are called holders and those who sell options are called
	writers. furthermore, buyers are said to have long positions, and sellers are said
	writers to have short positions.

	Here is the important distinction between buyers and sellers:
	Call holders and put holders (buyers) are not obligated to buy or
	sell. They have the choice to exercise their rights if they choose.
	Call writers and put writers (sellers), however, are obligated to
	buy or sell. This means that a seller may be required to make good on a
	promise to buy or sell.

The price at which an underlying stock can be purchased or sold is called the
strike price.
price . This is the price a stock price must go above (for calls) or go below
(for puts) before a position can be exercised for a profit. All of this must occur
before the expiration date.

An option that is traded on a national options exchange such as the Chicago
Board Options Exchange (CBOE) is known as a listed option. These have fixed
strike prices and expiration dates. Each listed option represents 100 shares of
company stock (known as a contract contract).

For call options, the option is said to be in-the-money if the share price is
above the strike price. A put option is in-the-money when the share price is
below the strike price. The amount by which an option is in-the-money is
referred to as intrinsic value.

The total cost (the price) of an option is called the premium
premium. This price is determined by factors including the stock price, strike price, time remaining
until expiration (time value) and volatility volatility. Because of all these factors,
determining the premium of an option is complicated and beyond the scope of this tutorial.

	Options Basics: Why Use Options?
=============================================================

Speculation
	Speculation is the territory in which the big money is made - and lost. The use
	of options in this manner is the reason options have the reputation of being
	risky. This is because when you buy an option, you have to be correct in
	determining not only the direction of the stock's movement, but also the
	magnitude and the timing of this movement. To succeed, you must correctly
	predict whether a stock will go up or down, and you have to be right about how
	much the price will change as well as the time frame it will take for all this to
	happen. And don't forget commissions! ! The combinations of these factors
	means the odds are stacked against you.

	So why do people speculate with options if the odds are so skewed? Aside
	from versatility, it's all about using leverage leverage. . When you are controlling 100
	shares with one contract, it doesn't take much of a price movement to generate
	substantial profits.

Hedging
	The other function of options is hedging
	hedging. . Think of this as an insurance policy.
	Just as you insure your house or car, options can be used to insure your
	investments against a downturn. Critics of options say that if you are so unsure
	of your stock pick that you need a hedge, you shouldn't make the investment.
	On the other hand, there is no doubt that hedging strategies can be useful,
	especially for large institutions. Even the individual investor can benefit.
	Imagine that you wanted to take advantage of technology stocks and their	
	upside, but say you also wanted to limit any losses. By using options,
	you would be able to restrict your downside while enjoying the full
	upside in a cost-effective way. (For more on this, see Married Puts: A
	Protective Relationship and A Beginner's Guide To Hedging.)
