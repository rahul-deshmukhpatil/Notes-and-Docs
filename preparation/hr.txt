I am a hard working and i set the very high goals.
I am coming from startup environment, where guys can handle resposibilities and pressures, working on multiple tasks.
Very good at c++ and quickly learning the new technologies/projects.
I know how to proceed fast, either by taking help or giving help.

Handle recruitment.
Handle team of 2-3 guys
I get short onsite opportunities
I get all cab, food facilities free.
I have around 20+ holidays 
I am very good at handling thier work, and even if you ask VPs in your company I am sure that they have very positive thinking about me


now you might ask me why I am looking for change.
Its not because i have got bored of hard work.
Its becuase these guys are failing to nurture us. They are providing less attention to our needs.
In recent months they are failing to recognise the our achievements and work.
SRLabs is not the same child which we loved after acquisition of wombat. 
Their strategy is changing to make revenues via strong, robust product to make revenues via just adding client numbers horizontally.
