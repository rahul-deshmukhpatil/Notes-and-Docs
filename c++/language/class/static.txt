static : 
	storage duration (auto till block/scope, static: till program, thread_local: till thread life)
	and linkage(intern, extern, etc)

	Header : static const int x;
	in an .hpp file then every translation unit that #include-s this .hpp will have its own private variable x.

Static members:
	class statics have global/extern linkage, while plain one dont have it
	can be incomplete tpye in declration
	but constexpr and inline must be complete type

	struct Foo;
	struct S
	{
		static int a[]; // declaration, incomplete type
		static Foo x;   // declaration, incomplete type

		//usecase MasterInstance; 
		static S s; // declaration, incomplete type (inside its own definition)
	};

	definition needs complete type in .cpp file, no need of word static
	int S::a[10]; // definition, complete type
	struct Foo {};
	Foo S::x;     // definition, complete type
	S S::s;       // definition, complete type

	can be private, public, prototected.
	can be used with  type X::static_func or x_instance.static_func

funcs:
	static funcs cant be virtual, const, volatile
	can be stored in function pointer rather than pointer to member func

members
	static data memb have external linkage if class has external linkage ie. 
		class not in unnamed namespace
		local classes : inside func, and unanemed classes cant have static data mmebers 
	C++17 inline static members can have initializer and doesnot need out of class definition

Const members (not volatile
	can have intiailzer value inside class, 
	otherwise , you must inititalize outside in cpp at definitiion time

constexpr
	must have intiailzer value inside class. 
	C++11: need redundant definition outside in cpp.
	
If non-inline const or constexpr is ODR used, i.e. address is taken then 
	c++11, you must have definition in cpp file, which cant have intiailizer again 
		if already provided in case of const, 
		for  constexpr its must in class declartion.
	c++17, Constexpr is now implicitely inline
		empty definition is redudedant so not needed
		its depricated in C++17.
