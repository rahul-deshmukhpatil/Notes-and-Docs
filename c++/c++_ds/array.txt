T[N] : as only non-static data member

satiesfies req of revesivble container : supports bidirectional and random itr

default constructed array is not empty
swap is linera time.


when len =0, begin == end , which is some uniq value as 0 lenth obj
is not possible so does not have address. also front(), back() have undefined result.

Iterators are not invalidated till lifetime of array.
But after iterators point to same array, so change its values to other arrays.

Whereas vector.swap does not call the move,copy or swap on individual elements
so its iterators remain valid except past the end
