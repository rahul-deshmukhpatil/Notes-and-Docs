1. only 1 main in global namespce, no overload, no recurisive
2. can not be deleted, decl with c lang linkage, constexpr, consteval, inline, static
3. implicit return 0. 
4. std::exit gets called after main function. Frees global, global static(internal linkage), local statics in opposite order of initialization
	remember you can only gurantee order of static initializations within single translation/compilation/.cpp unit
5. main can not have auto return type. because It has default implicit return type int and value 0.
6. main cant be coroutine

main function-try-catch block does not catch exceptions of destructors of globals and statics called in std::exit
