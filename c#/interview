	Tried to understand at philosophical level
	
	# contribution
	numerous video series about also .NET enviorment and c#

#Motivation for the change
	Analogy of the sea of trading opportunities
	passionate, want to move away from small fish netting to systematic big whale spear fish hunting

	HFT is more about small trades due to pricing errors or delays and opportunistic trading,
	but now would like to do more of generating systematic alpha with creative ideas over opportunistic trading

	more of a trading technology developer and not pure HFT/C++ developer. So my motivation for developing technology
	is changed from HFT to systematic trading. I am in the right field but on the different path than I want to be on now

#Strong points
	ability to convert verbal problem into software porject design and in the programming langauage
	while reverse capability to explain system/programming problem in english for business managers and traders
	
	I am self reader and good at reading code and creating good design understanding of existing projects

#Strong Weak strong point
	Can we multitasking with the context switches but not too much of parallel working. I can very well plan out multiple tasks 
	to complete in optimal ways

#Questions
	Wanted to know breifly about interesting or challanging problems you are solving now or in the queue for future development
		Speed optimization
		feature set of the trading platform

	Do you already have trading engine which could execute big orders are TVWAP or VWAP or you use external bank platforms for it
	do you use any RFQ platform for the OTC trades
