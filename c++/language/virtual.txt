virutal functions need
	name
	parameter type list (but not the return type)
	cv-qualifiers
	ref-qualifiers

private virtual func can be overridden in derived

virtual function called within class member func without pointer or ref
is also virtually dispatched. i.e implcite this-> is amended before 
call withing memb func to another memb func

final : stops overdding of virtual func
overrides : makes sure that its overriding base class func

fucntion with same name but diff params hides base virt function.

with qualfiied lookup you can call particular function  you want
	d.B::f();
	d.D::f();

irrespecitve of virt function is hidden by overlaoding in intemediate class
most derived class can see virt func in topmost base class.

covariants
	virt function overrident in derived class has return type convertible 
	to base class virt func ret type and its less strict ie. non-const than the
	base class ret type
