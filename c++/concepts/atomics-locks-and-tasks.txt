============== Mutex vs Sempahore ==================
Mutex : variable can give u lock to single resource. No communication with scheduler

Semaphore: count, count of resources locks. Has more communication with scheudler of processes
		wait : wait in Q: if count == 0 then wait by putting task into the queue
						otherwise decrease count and give lock to process
		signal : signal to Q : when wnat to give up semaphore, increase count and singal first process in queue
			to run
		sempahore might us4e mutext to synch access to counter


spin locks might be complex, if multiple same spin locks are attempted by two threads
it might run into deadlock
But they are good for short time acquizition, when there is less prob of contention/competetion

Data race
	i++ : is a read, modify and write operation
	this can not be atomic by default on any builtin integral type
	use atomic if possible

Critical Section
	Only one code should have access to critical section.
	Take locks or critial section. Analogy of entering into room
	
	Mutex must not be function local i.e. must be accessible to all threads
	Use mutex with lock_guard, which in case of exception raised still frees lock

	Mutex Limitations:
	1. Aquiring same mutex twice by same thread is undefined behavior
	2. You might take another lock insisde critical section room.
	3. You might come out of another door from critical section, forgeting free initial lock
		taken while entering.

	1. keep only minimum req, race code inside critical section
	2. Do not call any third party functions after taking lock. 
		3rd party unknown code might sleep or take time to execute in present or future
		Do only simple operations insid it otherwise called functions might sleep
		or change implementation. This will break code in future
	3. Lock inside lock is not a good idea.

	Deadlock
	Two locks req causes deadlock. Analogy of there are only two chopticks to eat noodle.
	and two people(threads) want to eat noodle acquiring locks.

	Solution:
		1. acquire locks in only same sequence. Not always possible.
		2. try_lock and give up lock after some time. Not so clean.
		3. c++11, try unique_lock, with std::defer_ptr 
			std::unique_lock ula(a.mut, std::defer_lock);
			std::unique_lock ulb(b.mut, std::defer_lock);
			std::lock lk(a.mut, b.mut); // local a.mut n b.mut in atomic way or wait in while
		4. c++17 clean n short way, use std::scoped_lock<std::mutex>  scLock(a.mut, b.mut);
	

	Suppose you want to have atomic counter, which is incremented by 1000 times by 1000 threads
	1. Better to use atomic, but its still not efficient
	2. Have a local variable, increment it. And the end add local var to counter
	Use local variables as possible.
