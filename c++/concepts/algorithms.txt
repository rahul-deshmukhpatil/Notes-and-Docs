Find max diff between two elements in the vector
	1. two iterations over vector
	2. sort and then  v.back() - v.front();
	3. min_element and max_element returns itr
	4. [minIter, maxIter] = minmax_element(v.begin, v.end)
		here complexity is same as 3, but more efficient
	5. range based loop = [minIter, maxIter] = minmax_element(v)



There is a family of functors which implements arithmatic ops for objects used
by the algos for custom user defined objects
	arith : plus, minus, mult, divides, modulus, negate ...
	comp : equal_to, not_eq_to, greater, less ...
	logical : logical_and, logical_or ...

shuffle : was intro in C++17
random_shuffle was removed in c++17

4 Key algo before c++11 
	pre C++11 : accumulate, partial sum, adj diff, inner_prod
	c++11 : iota
	c++17: reduce, exclusiv/inclu scan/transform, 
	Numberic algo : iota
