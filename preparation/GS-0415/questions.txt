coding round


=======================================
first : Manager general

why you are leaving.
what challenging work you have done.
What are challenges in your current job.
Discussed the coding round questions

=======================================
second : Technical 
Design a timer object class, which runs as saperate thread/process.
if you pass some time intervals in seconds to the TimerThread, you
should get the notifications and invoke the particular methods

Remove the even elements from the vector.
What are functors.

=======================================
third : Technical, puzzles

1> from list of m elements, take last n elements and insert them in front 
of the list.
2> if four people are standing at the each corner of square.
	they could run in any direction along square edge.
	calculate the probability for them to collide.
3> Given a cube of length 5, made up of small cubes of side 1.
	Each side is painted.
	1> find cubes whos no side is painted: 3^3 = 27
	2> 1 side is painted = 3^3 *6 =  54
	3> 2 sides are painted = 12 * 3 = 36.
	4> 3 sides are painted = 8 = 8.

	all sum is 125.

4> if you are pointing in north, if you turn right twice, and then turn left
	for 5 times, which direction you are pointing to.

	add for right, negate for left. And do mod 4 to the ans.
	and make those many turns, left or right, depending upon the sign after applying mod

5>  Rs 500 question.
