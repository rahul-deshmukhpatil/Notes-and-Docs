What happens in procratination
	- We have to do things, important for future or urgent right now
	- But things are not easy and fun
	- So our brain stresses out due to this burden and swells 
	- Do release this swelling on brain asks to do something easy and fun
	- And decide to do task later dedicatedly, productively and in most best way because current time is not best
	- this makes current situation easy but in future it hurts more
	- I fell behind schedule, guilt situation, humiliation
	- repeat points 1-5 until tasks with deadling is on the verge of failure to complete
	- here humilation of not doing "writing paper" gets over the writing "bad paper" in any way, 
	- its fear of not getting done exceeds fear of doing it perfectly, of exceptional standary, or of standard of last time
	- for personal self life objectives tasks without deadline feel guilty, worthless each day throughout life
	- deprieve us of good feeling
	- we do not achieve on time or get good grades for our work
	- We feel guilty that we could have been better

What should be done:
	- Understand gratification Monkey mind
	- Plan and place system to execute
	- Chunk big tasks into smaller
	- Just start with small and aim to complete the next one in the list
	- Take lead measures
	- Track progress

	Tim Urban: Inside the mind of a master procrastinator | TED
	 4,86,18,710 views  06-Apr-2016  Tim Urban knows that procrastination doesn't make sense, but he's never been able to shake his habit of waiting until the last minute to get things done. In this hilarious and insightful talk, Urban takes us on a journey through YouTube binges, Wikipedia rabbit holes and bouts of staring out the window -- and encourages us to think harder about what we're really procrastinating on, before we run out of time.

Rational Decision Maker vs Instant Gratification (Fun and Easy things)
Do worthless things endlessly in continuation
	- Watching worthless youtube
	- Watching freeze
	- reading FB, Twitter, reddit, Quora, News channel, reading magazines, story books, porn

Monkey mind -Instant Gratifiction , no knowledge of past and future
Rationl Decision = Harder and less pleasure things - help in big picture, long term plan

From Dark Playground of Monkey mind
	Panic monster can watching in darkest Moment
		- Bad feeling
		- Anxiety
		- Less performance
		- Breaking dreams
		- Explaines procration behaviros 
		- Just unable to start on the things until taks goes out of hand
		- Burnout in order to complete anyhow with less quality in deadline
Rational thinker
	- Do Hard things, atleast start
	- Thinks in future and get things done that will help in future
	- Dont find excuse to fail but lead measures to succeed and gratification of achieving

Two kinds of procratination
	- For things with deadline
		- professional commitments
		- academic 
		- has panic monster
	- For self long term objectives which dont have deadlines
		- panic monsters cant wake up 
		- long term procrastion 
		- Not visible
		- Much less talked about
		- Suffered quietly and privately
		- Long term makes feel not-happiness, frustration
		- Makes spectator, Self stopping from achieving self goals
		- Not stops from achieving but can not start itself

What to be done
	- Not many weeks in life to enjoy and achieve, not many years to live
	- Need to be aware of procrastination
	- start right now, right today

	Self Worth Theory: The Key to Understanding & Overcoming Procrastination | Nic Voge | TEDxPrincetonU
		20,93,743 views  20-Dec-2017  Nearly 80% of college students report that procrastination is a significant issue for them. Procrastination is not a matter of mere “laziness” and the solution is not simply “better time management”. Could it be that procrastination is actually a highly effective strategy for self-protection and that’s why we continue to do it? In this talk, Nic unravels the surprising and perplexing motivational dynamics underlying our procrastination that lead so often to disengagement and burnout. Illustrated with examples drawn from two decades of coaching students, he introduces self-worth theory of motivation, a powerful research-based conceptual framework for understanding and overcoming procrastination, avoidance, and over-commitment. Dominic (Nic) Voge is Senior Associate Director of Princeton University’s McGraw Center for Teaching and Learning, and author of “Life Beyond Grades” (Cambridge University Press). His work focuses on helping students truly thrive and achieve a sense of well-being not only academically, but in all realms of their lives. Nic is a founding member of The Resilience Consortium, the Princeton Perspective Project, and Principedia, initiatives designed to deepen engagement and learning among students. He maintains private consulting and coaching practices. This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.

	Self Worth thery
	Not just bad habit
	Look inside, deep motivation to understand procrastination to thrive in life

	Procrastination is pretty predictable, its not bad habit, weakness 
	you can predict with dynamics of motivation and circumstances under which it arrives
	
	Schools are competative, students are competing for grades A/, its evaluative env, more people compete for limiteded A grade/reward
	Students will try to get recognizition, more people want/expect to get A than actually could get
	So student become protective by meaning of not getting that A grade or reward, for thier self concept and self worth
	
	"Deadline goals have this self concept and worth, life goals dont have it"

	humilation of not doing "writing paper" gets over the writing "bad paper" in any way, 

	self worth theory : paramount pschylocial need is seen, recgonized, capable, competent and worthy
	So we trade off other needs to gain self worth

	Ability(skill/knowledge) + Performance(using hard work + effort) = Self Worth/Sucess/Achievement,  so Performnace drives self worth
	And then self worth drives Ability

	Procrastinator thinks Peformance  = Ability = Worth, so equation is wrong here
	Often Procrastinator procratinate about things they love, but reading paper at 23:00 PM is not love, its just you are trying to get done

	So task can have high success motivation or high fear of failure
	These are not two same things, but diff dimenntins

			High Fear of Failure
					^
					|
					|
					|  Over-striving
					|
	Low Success		|
	-------------------------------->High Sucess orientation
					|
					|
					|
					|
			Low Fear of Failure

	
	So you stuck between two boundries  ....... High Success Failure  >|< Fear of failure Failure 

	Procastrination is avoidance strategy, of self sabotaging, Getting into condition when you cant complete task in given time frame
	and then pulling out and burning out to complete sub-optimal quality and performance in limited time
	And then telling self and others that you faced these obstacles, but truth is that you had those obstacles excuses even before you begin in your mind
	These are backups to given reason and protecting, maintaining self worth
		If you Fail : You have reasons, but maintain self worth
		If you succeed : You did it in limited time, increase self worth

	Tests are brinksmen ship, how you pull off what you read at the time of exam,
	Its not about knowledge or ability

	Avoidance strategy
		Understand dynamics and root causes of procratination
			-  motive of avoidance : cleaning freeze before exam
			-  motive  of approach : doing chunk of work right now
		Subtle cases of procratination of working on lower prio tasks checking email, writing scripts for more than expected time
		More understanding we have of our tendencies(habits) and motivation	more likely we can overcome them

		then when you cultivate observers stance how do you feel like, what I am experiencing, how i thought
		Then you can actively choose what you want to feel, experience and think and what we are motivated by

		Next strategy tells how to do that
	
	Tip the balance from avoidance motive to approach motive
		There are benefits outside of completing taks. You signed for a reason, to learn, we dont think about that
		So motivation only work if we consiously think about benefits
		See approach motive as opportunity, see n think about benefits outside of box
		Make a simple outline of task to give sense of the whole, which can make you motivated
		get moving, get started , make progress
	
	Perf != Ability != Worth
		May be your choices reflect your Hopes
			and not your fears - Nelson  Mandela
		Can we motivated to do things we apspire
			by not pretending we dont have fear
			but despite them
