#Motivation for the change
	Analogy of the sea of trading opportunities
	passionate, want to move away from small fish netting to systematic big whale spear fish hunting

	HFT is more about small trades due to pricing errors or delays and opportunistic trading,
	but now would like to do more of generating systematic alpha with creative ideas over opportunistic trading

	more of a trading technology developer and not pure HFT/C++ developer. So my motivation for developing technology
	is changed from HFT to systematic trading. I am in the right field but on the different path than I want to be on now

#Questions
	Wanted to know breifly about interesting or challanging problems you are solving now or in the queue for future development
		Speed optimization
		feature set of the trading platform

	Do you already have trading engine which could execute big orders are TVWAP or VWAP or you use external bank platforms for it
	do you use any RFQ platform for the OTC trades
