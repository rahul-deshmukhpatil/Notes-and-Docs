using std::move to pass, caller allows the rvalue ref param to steal the resource.
now it depends on called function definition if it steals resources or not


void move_func(T&& t);

Calling:
	move_func(t); // should give error, binding lvalue to rvalue ref
	move_func(std::move(t)); //caller has allowed to steal resource, now passing by rvalue.
