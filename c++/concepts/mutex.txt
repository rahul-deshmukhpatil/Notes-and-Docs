mutex
	lock
	try_lock : returns bool
	unlock

	is undefined
		loc/unlock attempt to acquiring mutex by same thread if its already locked
		If threads die without freeing mutex 
		mutex is destroyed while in use
	
	cant be copied and moved
	used with lock_guard ( convenient RAII-style ), uniq_lock, scoped_lock, 

https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/330769/why-cant-i-check-whether-a-mutex-is-locked
	You can't really reasonably check whether a mutex is locked, because one nanosecond after the check it can get unlocked or locked. So if you wrote if (mutex_is_locked ()) â€¦ then mutex_is_locked could return the correct result, but by the time the if is executed, it is wrong.


uniq_lock: Provides owns_lock functionality which mutex does not provide.
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21892934/how-to-assert-if-a-stdmutex-is-locked

	by def tries to lock it
	otherwise 3 types of 2nd paramt o constr
		1. differ_t : dont acq now
		2. try_to_lock_t: if its mutex already locked then undef beh
		3. adopt_t : assumes lock is acq already. 
	4th constr : try to acq for next t time period or till its acq
	5th constr : try to acq for until time t, or till its acq
	is only movable

	owns_lock:
	operator bool : both tell if lock is acq 

	lock, try_lock, unlock
	try_lock_for(time_period)
	try_lock_until(timestamp)

lockguard : not copyablei, not copy constr
std::scoped_lock offers a replacement for lock_guard that provides the ability to lock multiple mutexes using a deadlock avoidance algorithm.

lock: tries to lock,try_lock, unlock to multiple std::uniq_locks or lockable objects. 
	if single lock is not acq all locks are freed. or in case of exception all acq locks are freed.

scoped_lock: locks multiple mutexes in give order and unlocks them at the end of scope/block
	using deadlock avoidance algorithm


func()
{
	//std::mutex m; // wrong: this will be always free. its on stack.
	
	// so use global mutex;
	gmutex.lock(); // wrong, gmutex might be acquried by same thread.

	
}
