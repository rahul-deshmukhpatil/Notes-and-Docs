better than union
	holds only objects or pointers
		array, void, ref are not allowed
	
	default constructible to first type in declaration
		if 1st type is not constructible then variant is not def constructible

	When intialized with list of objects, initialize  to first one.
	
	holds atleaset 1 type or use monostate to represent value less state 
		i.e. when 1st type is not def constructigble
	
	can have same type twice or cv of same types 

	get<type or index> : throws error at compile time for bad acess to non uniq or out of bound index.
				: if type or index is not current value then vad access
	
	get_if<type or index> returns null in case of its not curretn value stored

	variant_size :count of elements
	variant_alternative_t<index> :  type at index.


	visit(visistor vis, var1, var2) :  calls visitor lambda/functor given with variant values are param types and arguments.
