===== Company and position within orgranisation==========
I am working here with the SRLabs from day one. Have brought up  the India 
operations from initial days till the point where we handle and held 
responsible for almost 12 hours of company operation.
We work in environment where we are quiet aware that if we get slow our 
business gonna get slow. Sometimes do work on weekeneds
as well aware that all the upgradation,system checkups is possible at that time only.

===== About current work ============
I am a heavy coder of both c++ as well as scripting, involved in the 
feature additions, small projects as well as long term assignments. Love to 
have shortcut/scripts for every thing that is done repeatedly.
We are a small company, 30 people with around 20-30 million revenue. so we 
work in very global collaborating environment where everyone knows what 
other guys is strong at and upon what he is currently working. We tightly 
track the development and everything that we are responsible for is getting timely addressed.
If necessory take over the tasks left by US team and many times give the tasks when they 
step in depending upon urgency. 
I am good at working at multiples tasks with the prioritizing the important 
and urgent one. I am heavily involved in talking and taking requirements 
from European clients while mine friend handles the Japan/Australia.  
Mostly in case of citi, I know Belfast and Canary wharf guys.
Flexible guy, young and willing to travel if needs. 

=========== Long term goal and stragtegies =============
I do not just believe in coding and developing projects from scratch.  I am 
always curious to know big scenario, how my work is affecting business and 
how it interacts with other modules and what are other modules 
functionality. Knowing these kind of details in peace periods helps 
in war at the time of production outages, well not literally war but both 
of us know its a very critical and tense situation << like tense situation in 
yesterdays india pak match. >> As well we are constantly involved in 
automating the alerts and things that could prevent outages. 

========== View about financial industry ====================
I am well aware that finance technology is all about being being smart, 
being first or you have to cheat. Well I do not cheat so  always try to act 
smart way that too first. I am a hard worker, quick lerner and set my goals high.

Though having 5 years of experience as member of technical staff. we handle 
lot of responsibilities.
Here I manage and guide group of 3-4 guys and european work. Even I look after the India 
recruitment. While mine friend looks after asia/pacefic work and other infra.

=========== Personal Life =============
<<Apart from this in personal life. I am living at hostels, outside of home 
for last 16 years, from 5th standard in army residential school.>> 
Disciplined about my work and believe in timely completing work and enjoy 
my life fully after that. Belives investing time in right activities gives better returns than investing money.
Love to master the different developement tools. Love to sketch and other hobby is trekking. Since 
living outside of home for long time, quiet good at making friends and 
getting mixed in other groups. 

<<
=========== How you could use me =============
That is what you have to decide, but let me give short idea, where you could get maximum of me.
Apart from market making team, I could help way beyond to increase the productvity of teams which are using SRLabs software.
