Why structs are more efficient than classes
	https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13049/whats-the-difference-between-struct-and-class-in-net
	value type lives on stack, reference type variable lives on stack which contains reference or pointer to heap memory where actual body of the 
	reference type lives

	value types memory is freed automatically and deterministic
	refernce types freed at runtime after all refernces get exausted and its still non-deterministic when they are freed

	struct have default public access specifier, class have private?
	structs cant be inherit from except from System.ValueType
	struct can not be base class either : ie sealed
	Abstract and sealed modifiers are not allowed and struct member cannot be protected or protected internals.
	No abstract or virtual members. Only override the methods from the System.ValueType (or System.Object ? check)
	A struct can implement interfaces
	A struct can be used as a nullable type and can be assigned a null value.
	
	struct is made to copy the whole object efficiently
	class are big and made to copy only reference. So any change via one reference to same object is visible via another reference variable

	Do not define a structure unless the type has all of the following characteristics:

	It logically represents a single value, similar to primitive types (integer, double, and so on).
	It has an instance size smaller than 16 bytes.
	It is immutable.
	It will not have to be boxed freque

Why int is boxed to object while passing to the WriteLine

	WriteLine accepts the string and array of Objects. To convert value type into object you box it
