unless [[no_unique_address]] specified for member

every memb of class, or any object should have diff address
except : Base class.

some relation with the std layout obj:
	that pointer to SLO converted using reinterpret cast should point to
	first member of obj.
	So SLO should have all non-static functions only in single class.
	 as with EBO all empty base classes share starting address.
	 Also first member of class must not be same as any of Base Classes in
	 indirect or direct.

EBO might be used by STL containers to store stateless allocator which is empty.
	its saved along with the one of the reqquired data such as iterator begin.end
	or capacity pointer  using the boost::compressed_string
