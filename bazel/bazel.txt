has rules, func and macros in .bzl files

Phases
	load
	analysis
	execution

Uses starlark language similar to python
	- without class (use struct function)
	- dict, list : mutable
	- int, none, string  same as python
	- exception keywords => use fail for fatal error
	- instead of 'is' use  ==
	- for loop only at top level, no recrusion
	- global vars are immutable
	- most of python builtin methods and functions are NOT availalbe

Macros:
	might contain chain of calls to rules

Rule creation: 
	- impl function
	- attrs
	- must have executable=True
	  or must have explicite test=True ===> rule name must have suffix  "_test"
