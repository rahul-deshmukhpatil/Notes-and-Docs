The noexcept-specification is a part of the function type and may appear as part of any function declarator.

Throwing functions are
	1. Default func() // def noexcept(false)
	2. destr without explicite noexpect(true) specifier
	2. constr, move, copy constr: 
			which are implicetly declared by compiler
			= defaulted on first declaration
	 unless:
	 	all of its memb and its bases are non-throwing
		default memb iniitalizer is non-throwing
