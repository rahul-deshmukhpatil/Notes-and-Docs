6.1>state Model of process
	Process table entry
	u-Area	

6.2> Memory mgmt, how os-hardware co-oprate for virtual memory.

6.3> Context of process, algorithms to manipulate context of process.

6.4> How kernel saves context of process during interrupt, sys call, context switch and how it resumes the process suspended earlier.

6.5> sys calls algorithms used to manipulate the address space of the process.

6.6> sys calls used to putting process into sleep and waking it up.
 

6.1 Process states, table entry and u-area
===============================================================================

Process states
	a> user running.
	b> kernel running.
	c> process ready to run.
	d> process blocked in kernel/sleep.
	e> sleeped swapped out by swapper (process 0).
	f> ready to run swapped out.
	g> process switching from kernel to user mode.
	h> process created using fork.
	i> process termiated from exit.
